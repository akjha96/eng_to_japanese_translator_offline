# eng_to_japanese_translator_offline_app

Hi all, This is my first python app which converts english to japanese. "Whaaaaatt But I can  use  google translate for that!"...
Wooaah, Let me finish. IT WORKS OFFLINE and you can have it on the go. Feel free to use it whenever and where ever you want. 

There is a requirements.txt file which needs to be installed before this app is workable. So go ahead and use this app. Its a simple app.
The output is currently stored in a text file of all your conversations. So you are never lost!

I hope you like this project. All contributers are welcome.
It will be a great hands on for any newcomer to python wanting to test a real world  application.

Thank you!
